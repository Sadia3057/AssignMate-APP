# AssignMate-APP
AssignMate is a user-centric application catering to the needs of students and  educators. It offers two distinct roles: Student Login and Faculty Login.  Students can upload assignments for different subjects, check their submission  status, and receive reminders for deadlines.  Faculty members can view the status 
of assignment submissions for their courses, track which students have submitted 
or not submitted, and send reminders to ensure compliance. The appâ€™s primary 
goal is to automate the assignment management process, reducing manual errors 
and saving time. By fostering a structured communication channel, AssignMate 
creates a more productive educational experience for all users. 
Through its innovative design and robust functionality, AssignMate aligns itself 
with the growing trend of digital transformation in education, providing a 
platform that empowers both students and faculty to achieve their academic goals 
efficiently. It represents a significant step forward in simplifying assignment 
workflows while maintaining the quality and integrity of educational processes.
